## Components of Exposure

- ISO: The sensitivity of a digital sensor to light
 Increasing ISO makes the digital sensor more sensitive but also can increase the amount of noise in a picture.

- Shutter Speed: The speed at which the lens shutter opens and closes.
Motion blur occurs because something in your shot is moving faster than your exposure time.

- Aperture: The actual hole through which light enters the lens.
The aperture of the camera’s lens is responsible for setting a picture’s depth of field.
When something is out of focus, it appears blurry.
